# insitu.obs.project

These programs are examples of analyses I did for my PhD dissertation. I do not include any of the "OB" datasets (or BRW data which is also included) since some of the work has yet to be published. This repository has been uploaded to strictly to showcase my skillset.

Feel free to reach out if you have further questions.


insitu_obs.py --> cleans up multiple OB csv files and organizes into one main csv that is used in project; data for BRW has already been cleaned in other projects (will see listed as brwfull)

definitions.py --> stats/labels/colors used throughout project; functions called when needed

basic_info.py --> script to provide information about dataset

some_stats.py --> trend calculation following NOAA GML method; linear regression of OB insitu obs

cartopy_map.py --> sample map of north polar stereo projection with OB data lat/lon tracks and points for land stations on Arctic coastline; example is here as cartopy_out.png
